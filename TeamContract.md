## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

All official team communications will be carried out on Discord. All members are expected to respond to direct messages within 24 hours, barring any exigent circumstances that would prevent a prompt response.

All team members are expected to meet agreed upon deadlines. If they are unable to do so, they must inform the team in a reasonably prompt manner. All team members are also expected to inform the team if they are unable to attend a lab or lecture.

Acknowledging Section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, all group members are equal before the law, and are subject to equal protection and equal responsibility. We hold firmly that all group members are entitled to certain fundamental rights, including:
* The right to free speech and expression
* The right to initiate a group vote regarding any material matter involving the relevant project.

We also agree to respect the rights of other group members, including but not limited to:
* Listen to others' ideas.
